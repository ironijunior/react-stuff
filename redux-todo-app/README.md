# TodoApp - Redux

Simple Todo application using React and Redux.

In this version I'm using Redux with React.

### To start the backend:
```
cd ./backend
npm install
npm run production
```
* It's necessary to have the MongoDB installed.

### To start the frontend:
```
cd ./frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
